Python 2.7 is used for this assignment.
"test.py" is the excutable, which takes the three parameters (as args) as required.
I also include an improved version of Apriori, which can be executed by adding "improved" as an additional argument.
For example:
	To run original Apriori: test.py "T10I4D100K.dat" 500 "output500.dat"
	To run improved Apriori: test.py "T10I4D100K.dat" 500 "output500.dat" improved

The improved one will produce a deviated output... So that is why I put both original and improved version in the zip file. And the original Apriori may take a long time to run.
