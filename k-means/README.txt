Python 2.7 is used for this assignment.
"kmeans.py" itself is excutable, which takes the three parameters (as args) as required (the name of the dataset file, k, and the name of the output file).
For example: kmeans.py iris 3 irisOutput

The output will be of the following format: it keeps the original data and add a new (last) colomn to it which is the classified labels generated by the program, and the last row displays the SSE for this clustering.
