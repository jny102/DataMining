Python 2.7 is used to implement c4.5 decision tree and naive bayes classification.
Both "c45.py" and "bayes.py" are excutable, which takes the three parameters, inputTrainingData, inputTestData, and outputName.
For example: c45.py mushroom.training mushroom.test c45output

The output will be of the following format: it keeps the original data and add a new (last) colomn to it which is the classified labels generated by the program, so that one can compare the true class label with the predicted label. And the first row is just a statement that shows the accuracy.
